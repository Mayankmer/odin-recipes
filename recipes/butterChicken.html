    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy 
        (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil,
        butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. 
        Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into roughly 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup full-fat plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the gravy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 to 10 whole cashews</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Kasuri Methi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. 
            Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) 
            before preparing the rest of the recipe.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.</p>
            <p>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, 
                until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). 
                Do not crowd the pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. 
                As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. 
                Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
            <p>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, 
                until all the extra liquid is cooked off. 
                The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.</p>
            <p>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Turn off the heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Purée the sauce with the nuts</li>
        <li>
            <p>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. 
                Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.</p>
            <p>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. 
                Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>

        </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. 
            Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. 
            Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>
